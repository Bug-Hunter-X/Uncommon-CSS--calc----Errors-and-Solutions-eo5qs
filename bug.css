The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations with different units. However, there are some uncommon errors related to its usage that can cause unexpected behavior. One such error is using invalid operators within the `calc()` function. For example, using the `%` operator without a number can lead to incorrect results. Another error is forgetting to include spaces around operators; for example, `width:calc(100%-10px)` is incorrect and should be written as `width:calc(100% - 10px)`.  Additionally, nested `calc()` functions should be handled carefully. Incorrect nesting might lead to unexpected behaviors.  Also, mixing different units without proper conversion can lead to incorrect outputs. Lastly, an issue may arise when `calc()` is used with properties that do not accept calculated values.
